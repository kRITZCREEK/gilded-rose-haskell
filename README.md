# Haskell port of the Gilded-Rose Kata

This is a Haskell port of the *Gilded-Rose-Kata*. For more information visit
https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata.

## Building and Running

You'll need `npm` installed and used it to install `bower`, `pulp`, and the compiler with `npm i -g purescript pulp bower`.

Run `bower install` to install dependencies, and `pulp test` to build and test after each refactoring.
